# CycleGAN-tf

*work in progress*

A TensorFlow 2.3 implementation of [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf).

The implementation was used as a training exercise for learning about GANs and also model and layer subclassing in TensorFlow. Hopefully its useful for people looking to implement CycleGAN themselves using a recent version of TensorFlow. Other examples of the model architecture in TensorFlow often use older versions of package. 

As of right now the model is fully functional. Training and experimentation has been carried out using the datasets provided by the authors in the original paper. A few test runs have been carried out and results look promising. I hope to run full model training job soon and post the results.
